end: end argument allows us to put something at the end of the line after it is printed. In simple words, it allows us to continue the line with " " or ',' or anything we put inside these quotes of the end.
It simply joins two different print statements using some string or even by space. Example:

"""

# print statement for printing strings
print("Harry is a programmer", end="**")

# Print statement with a literal
print(1+87)

#This will print "Harry is a programmer**88" on the screen
